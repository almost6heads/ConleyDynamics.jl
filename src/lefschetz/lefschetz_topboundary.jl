    lefschetz_topboundary(lc::LefschetzComplex, subcomp::Vector{Int})

Compute the topological boundary of a Lefschetz complex subset.

In contrast to the algebraic boundary defined via the boundary operator,
this function computes the boundary of the Lefschetz complex subset
specified in `subcomp` if the Lefschetz complex is interpreted as a
finite topological space. In other words, the topological boundary
is the set difference of the closure and the interior of the subset.
