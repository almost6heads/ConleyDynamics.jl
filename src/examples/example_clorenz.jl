export example_clorenz

"""
    lc, mvf = example_clorenz()

Create the simplicial complex and multivector field
for the example from Figure 3 in the JCD 2016 paper
by Kaczynski, Mrozek, and Wanner.

The function returns the Lefschetz complex `lc` over the
finite field GF(2) and the multivector field `mvf`.

# Examples
