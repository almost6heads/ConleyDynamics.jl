# Contributing to ConleyDynamics.jl 

Contributions are more than welcome. Please follow the guidelines outlined in
the following.

## Documentation Improvements 

An easy way to contribute to the package is to make pull requests fixing any
issues you see with documentation, for example correcting any typos or rewriting
an unclear sentence. In these cases, a simple pull request correcting the issue
is sufficient. If the improvement is a bit more substantial, make sure to explain
the issue clearly in the description of your pull request.

## Writing a Pull Request

For changes beyond simple documentation improvements, your pull request description
should have more detail. Some loose requirements are listed below. The point of these
requirements is not to make you concerned about the amount of work needed to fulfill
them, but to ensure that your contribution can be accepted easily without the reviewer
and yourself needing to go back-and-forth to meet the package's standards. If you do
not meet them, you may still be fine depending on what you are contributing. You can
always ask for help.

1. Outline what your pull request does in the description
2. Document any new functions
3. Include appropriate tests 
4. Try to only do one thing per pull request

## Performance Improvements

In addition to the guidance above for making a pull request, if your contribution
is aimed at improving performance, benchmarks comparing the results with and without
your change are extremely useful.

## Feature Contributions

If you want to contribute a new feature then, depending on how substantial the feature
is, please make an issue or a discussion thread (in the discussions tab) to discuss your
ideas first. If there is already an existing feature request in the discussions tab,
comment there with some ideas. This will help make sure we get the design of your
feature right and that we can help each other.
