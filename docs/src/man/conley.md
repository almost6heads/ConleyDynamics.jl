# Conley Theory

Here we need a more detailed description of Conley theory, and in particular
connection matrices.  In particular, this should discuss the various field types
that can be used, as well as all the entries in the [`ConleyMorseCM`](@ref) data
structure.

## Morse Decomposition Intervals

We briefly return to one of the examples in the tutorial. More precisely, we
consider the planar ordinary differential equation given by

```math
   \begin{array}{rcl}
     \dot{x}_1 & = & x_1 \left( 1 - x_1^2 - 3 x_2^2 \right) \\[1ex]
     \dot{x}_2 & = & x_2 \left( 1 - 3 x_1^2 - x_2^2 \right)
   \end{array}
```

The dynamics of this system is characterized by the existence of a global
attractor in the shape of a closed disk. Inside the attractor, there are
nine different Morse sets:

- The origin is an equilibrium of index 2, i.e., it is an unstable
  stationary state with a two-dimensional unstable manifold.
- The four points ``(\pm 1/2, \pm 1/2)`` are unstable equilibria of
  index 1, i.e., with a one-dimensional unstable manifold.
- Finally, the four points ``(\pm 1, 0)`` and ``(0, \pm 1)`` are
  asymptotically stable stationary states.

We saw in the tutorial that the Morse decomposition of this system
can easily be found using `ConleyDynamics.jl`, as well as the
associated connection matrix. Yet, in certain situations one might
only be interested in part of the dynamics on the attractor. Moreover,
while the Morse sets describe the recurrent part of the dynamics, they
do not provide information on the geometry of the connecting sets between
the Morse sets. In the following, we illustrate how this can be analyzed
further.

The right-hand side of the above vector field can be implemented using
the Julia function

```@example Cmorseinterval
using ..ConleyDynamics # hide
using Random # hide
Random.seed!(1234) # hide
function planarvf(x::Vector{Float64})
    #
    # Sample planar vector field with nontrivial Morse decomposition
    #
    x1, x2 = x
    y1 = x1 * (1.0 - x1*x1 - 3.0*x2*x2)
    y2 = x2 * (1.0 - 3.0*x1*x1 - x2*x2)
    return [y1, y2]
end
```

To analyze the resulting global dynamical behavior, we first create a
simplicial mesh covering the square ``[-6/5, 6/5]^2`` using the commands

```@example Cmorseinterval
lc, coords = create_simplicial_delaunay(300, 300, 5, 50);
coordsN = convert_planar_coordinates(coords,[-1.2,-1.2], [1.2,1.2]);
lc.ncells
```

The integer in the output gives the number of cells in the created Lefschetz
complex ``X``. Note that we are using a Delaunay triangulation over an initial
box of size ``300 \times 300``, where the target triangle size is about 5.
This box is then rescaled to cover the above square. We can then create a 
multivector field on the simplicial complex `lc` and find its Morse
decomposition using the commands

```@example Cmorseinterval
mvf = create_planar_mvf(lc, coordsN, planarvf);
morsedecomp = morse_sets(lc, mvf);
length(morsedecomp)
```

As expected, `ConleyDynamics.jl` finds exactly nine Morse sets. Their 
Conley indices can be computed and stored in a `Vector{Vector{Int}}`
using the command

```@example Cmorseinterval
conleyindices = [conley_index(lc, mset) for mset in morsedecomp]
```

These Conley indices correspond to the dynamical behavior near the
equilibrium solutions described above.

Suppose now that rather than finding the connection matrix for the
complete Morse decomposition, we would only like to consider a 
part of it. This can be done as long as we restrict our attention
to an *interval in the Morse decomposition*. Such an interval
``\mathcal{I}`` can be created from a selection ``\mathcal{S}``
of the Morse sets in the following way:

- In addition to the Morse sets in ``\mathcal{S}``, the interval
  ``\mathcal{I}`` contains all Morse sets that lie between two
  Morse sets in ``\mathcal{S}`` with respect to the poset order
  underlying the Morse decomposition. Recall that this poset order
  can be computed via [`morse_sets`](@ref) by activating the extra
  return object `hasse`, which describes the Hasse diagram of the
  poset.

With every interval ``\mathcal{I}`` of the Morse decomposition one
can assign a smallest isolated invariant set ``X_{\mathcal{I}}
\subset X`` which describes the complete dynamics within and
between the Morse sets in ``\mathcal{I}``. In fact, in can be
characterized as follows:

- The set ``X_{\mathcal{I}}`` consists of all cells in the 
  underlying Lefschetz complex ``X`` through which one can find
  a solution which originates in one Morse set of ``\mathcal{I}``
  and ends in another Morse set of ``\mathcal{I}``, where the
  two involved Morse sets can be the same. In other words, one
  needs to combine the interval Morse sets with all *connecting
  orbits* between them.

The two above steps can be performed in `ConleyDynamics.jl` using
the function [`morse_interval`](@ref).

In our example, we consider two intervals. The first interval
consists of the five Morse sets corresponding to all unstable
equilibrium solutions, while the second one considers the
four index 1 and the four stable stationary states. The
associated isolated invariant sets for these two intervals
can be computed as follows:

```@example Cmorseinterval
subset1 = findall(x -> x[2]+x[3]>0, conleyindices);
subset2 = findall(x -> x[1]+x[2]>0, conleyindices);
lcsub1 = morse_interval(lc, mvf, morsedecomp[subset1]);
lcsub2 = morse_interval(lc, mvf, morsedecomp[subset2]);
[length(subset1), length(subset2), length(lcsub1), length(lcsub2)]
```

The output shows that we have in fact extracted five and eight
Morse sets, respectively. It also shows that the Lefschetz
complexes corresponding to these two isolated invariant sets
are much smaller than ``X``.

So far, we have just determined the collections of cells that 
correspond to the two isolated invariant sets for these intervals.
We can now restrict the combinatorial dynamics to these subsets. 
Note that since they are both isolated invariant sets, they are
locally closed in ``X``, and therefore the restrictions provide
us with two new Lefschetz complexes `lcr1` and `lcr2`, along with
induced multivector fields `mvfr1` and `mvfr2`, respectively. In
`ConleyDynamics.jl`, this is achieved using the commands

```@example Cmorseinterval
lcr1, mvfr1 = restrict_dynamics(lc, mvf, lcsub1);
lcr2, mvfr2 = restrict_dynamics(lc, mvf, lcsub2);
[lcr1.ncells, lcr2.ncells]
```

It is now easy to find the connection matrices for these two
intervals. The first connection matrix is given by

```@example Cmorseinterval
cmr1 = connection_matrix(lcr1, mvfr1);
cmr1.conley
```

```@example Cmorseinterval
full_from_sparse(cmr1.matrix)
```

It clearly shows that the unstable index 2 Morse set
has connecting orbits to every one of the four index 1 
equilibria. Similarly, the second connection matrix can
be determined as

```@example Cmorseinterval
cmr2 = connection_matrix(lcr2, mvfr2);
cmr2.conley
```

```@example Cmorseinterval
full_from_sparse(cmr2.matrix)
```

In this case, every index 1 equilibrium is connected 
two its two neighboring stable stationary states via
heteroclinics that are detected by the connection matrix.

The Lefschetz complexes associated with the two Morse
decomposition intervals can also be visualized in
`ConleyDynamics.jl`. For this, recall that the function
[`plot_planar_simplicial_morse`](@ref) can plot an underlying
simplicial complex together with any collection of cell 
subsets. For our purposes, we use the following commands:

```julia
show1 = [[lcr1.labels]; cmr1.morse];
show2 = [[lcr2.labels]; cmr2.morse];
fname1 = "/Users/wanner/Desktop/invariantinterval2d1.png"
fname2 = "/Users/wanner/Desktop/invariantinterval2d2.png"
plot_planar_simplicial_morse(lc, coordsN, fname1, show1, vfac=1.1, hfac=2.0)
plot_planar_simplicial_morse(lc, coordsN, fname2, show2, vfac=1.1, hfac=2.0)
```

The variable `show1` collects not only the Morse sets that
are part of the first connection matrix `cmr1`, but also the
support of the Lefschetz complex `lcr1`. This support is accessed
via `[lcr1.labels]`, and we add it as a first vector of cells
in `show1`. Similarly, we determine the support of the second 
isolated invariant set, together with the Morse sets of `cmr2`.
The remaining four commands create two images.

![Interval support for the first interval](img/invariantinterval2d1.png)

The first image shows the five Morse sets surrounding the stationary
states at the origin and at ``(\pm 1/2, \pm 1/2)``. In addition, it
highlights the support of the isolated invariant set associated with
this Morse decomposition interval. One can clearly see rough outer
approximations for the four heteroclinics which start at the origin
and end at the index 1 equilibria. These approximations are necessarily
coarse, since we are not working with a very fine triangulation.

![Interval support for the second interval](img/invariantinterval2d2.png)

Finally, the second image depicts the eight Morse sets enclosing
the index 1 and the stable stationary states. It also shows the
support of the Lefschetz complex `lcr2` which is associated with this
Morse decomposition interval. In this case, it covers eight different
heteroclinic orbits, which are in fact better approximated than the
four in the previous image.

## Cubical Analysis of a Planar System

Our next example illustrates how `ConleyDynamics.jl` can be used to analyze
the global dynamics of a planar ordinary differential equations. For this,
consider the planar system

```math
   \begin{array}{rcl}
     \dot{x}_1 & = &  x_2 - x_1 \left( x_1^2 + x_2^2 - 4 \right)
       \left( x_1^2 + x_2^2 - 1 \right) \\[1ex]
     \dot{x}_2 & = & -x_1 - x_2 \left( x_1^2 + x_2^2 - 4 \right)
       \left( x_1^2 + x_2^2 - 1 \right)
   \end{array}
```

This system has already been considered in [mrozek:etal:22a](@cite).
The right-hand side of this vector field can be implemented using
the Julia function

```@example Ccircle
using ..ConleyDynamics # hide
function circlevf(x::Vector{Float64})
    #
    # Sample vector field with nontrivial Morse decomposition
    #
    x1, x2 = x
    c0 = x1*x1 + x2*x2
    c1 = (c0 - 4.0) * (c0 - 1.0)
    y1 =  x2 - x1 * c1
    y2 = -x1 - x2 * c1
    return [y1, y2]
end
```

To analyze the global dynamics of this vector field, we first create
a cubical complex covering the square ``[-3, 3]^2`` using the commands

```@example Ccircle
n = 51
lc, coords = create_cubical_rectangle(n,n,p=2);
coordsN = convert_planar_coordinates(coords,[-3.0,-3.0],[3.0,3.0]);
lc.ncells
```

As the last result shows, this gives a Lefschetz complex with 10609
cells. The multivector field can be generated using

```@example Ccircle
mvf = create_planar_mvf(lc, coordsN, circlevf);
length(mvf)
```

This multivector field consists of 2437 multivectors. Finally, the 
connection matrix can be determined using the command

```@example Ccircle
cm = connection_matrix(lc, mvf);
cm.conley
```

Therefore, the above planar system has three isolated invariant sets.
One has the Conley index of a stable equilibrium, while the other two
have that of a stable and an unstable periodic orbit. The columns of
the connection matrix correspond to these invariant sets as follows

```@example Ccircle
cm.poset
```

The connection matrix itself is given by

```@example Ccircle
full_from_sparse(cm.matrix)
```

This implies that there are connecting orbits from the unstable 
periodic orbit to both the stable equilibrium, and the stable
periodic orbit. To visualize these Morse sets, we employ the 
commands

```julia
fname = "cubicalcircles.pdf"
plot_planar_cubical_morse(lc, fname, cm.morse, pv=true)
```

![Morse sets of the planar circles vector field](img/cubicalcircles.png)

In the above example we used the original fixed cubical grid,
which is just a scaled version of the grid on the integer
lattice. It is also possible to work with a *randomized
grid*, in which the coordinates of the vertices are randomly
perturbed. This can be achieved with the following commands:

```julia
nR = 75
lcR, coordsR = create_cubical_rectangle(nR,nR,p=2,randomize=0.33);
coordsRN = convert_planar_coordinates(coordsR,[-3.0,-3.0],[3.0,3.0]);
mvfR = create_planar_mvf(lcR, coordsRN, circlevf);
cmR = connection_matrix(lcR, mvfR);
fnameR = "cubicalcirclesR.pdf"
plot_planar_cubical_morse(lcR, coordsRN, fnameR, cmR.morse, pv=true, vfac=1.1, hfac=2.0)
```

![Morse sets of the planar circles vector field via randomized cubes](img/cubicalcirclesR.png)

To constrast the above example with the use of a Delaunay triangulation,
we reanalyze the vector field in the following way:

```julia
lc2, coords2 = create_simplicial_delaunay(400, 400, 10, 30, p=2)
coords2N = convert_planar_coordinates(coords2,[-3.0,-3.0], [3.0,3.0])
mvf2 = create_planar_mvf(lc2, coords2N, circlevf)
cm2 = connection_matrix(lc2, mvf2)

fname2 = "cubicalcircles2.pdf"
plot_planar_simplicial_morse(lc2, coords2N, fname2, cm2.morse, pv=true)
```

In this case, the Morse sets can be visualized as in the figure.

![Morse sets of the planar circles vector field via Delaunay](img/cubicalcircles2.png)

Notice that we can also show the individual multivectors in more detail.
For the above example, we can plot all multivectors of the multivector
field `mvf2` which consist of at least 10 cells using the commands

```julia
mv_indices = findall(x -> (length(x)>9), mvf2)
large_mv = mvf2[mv_indices]

fname3 = "cubicalcircles3.pdf"
plot_planar_simplicial_morse(lc2, coords2N, fname3, large_mv, pv=true)
```

![Large multivectors in the Delaunay multivector field](img/cubicalcircles3.png)

Note that in this example, there are only 20 large multivectors.

## Cubical Analysis of a Spatial System

It is also possible to analyze certain three-dimensional ordinary
differential equations in `ConleyDynamics.jl`. To provide one such
example, consider the system

```math
   \begin{array}{rcl}
     \dot{x}_1 & = & (\lambda-1) x_1 - \frac{3\lambda}{2\pi}
       \left( (x_1^3 - x_1^2 x_3 + x_2^2 x_3 + 2 x_1
       \left( x_2^2 + x_3^2 \right) \right) \\[1ex]
     \dot{x}_2 & = & (\lambda-4) x_2 - \frac{3\lambda}{2\pi} \;
       x_2 \left( 2 x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 2 x_1 x_3 + 2 x_3^2 \right) \\[1ex]
     \dot{x}_3 & = & (\lambda-9) x_3 + \frac{\lambda}{2\pi}
       \left( x_1 \left( x_1^2 - 3 x_2^2 \right) - 3 x_3
       \left( 2 x_1^2 + 2 x_2^2 + x_3^2 \right) \right)
   \end{array}
```

This system arises in the study of the so-called *Allen-Cahn equation*,
which is the parabolic partial differential equation given by

```math
   u_t = \Delta u + \lambda \left( u - u^3 \right)
   \;\;\;\text{ in }\;\;\; \Omega = (0,\pi)
   \quad\text{ with }\quad
   u = 0 \;\;\;\text{ on }\;\;\; \partial\Omega \; .
```

This partial differential equation can be interpreted as an
infinite-dimensional system of ordinary differential equations,
see for example [sander:wanner:pdebook; Section 6.1](@cite).
For this, one has to expand the unknown function ``u(t,\cdot)`` as
a generalized Fourier series with respect to the basis functions

```math
   \varphi_k(x) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}} \, \sin(k \pi x)
   \quad\text{ for }\quad
   k \in \mathbb{N} \; .
```

If one truncates this series representation after three terms, and
projects the right-hand side of the partial differential equation
onto the linear space spanned by the first three basis functions,
then the three coefficients of the approximating sum satisfy the
above three-dimensional ordinary differential equation. Thus, this
system provides a model for the dynamics of the partial differential
equation, at least for sufficiently small values of the parameter
``\lambda``. It can be implemented in Julia using the following
commands:

```julia
function allencahn3d(x::Vector{Float64})
    #
    # Allen-Cahn projection
    #
    lambda = 3.0 * pi
    c      = lambda / pi
    x1, x2, x3 = x
    y1 = (lambda-1)*x1 - 1.5*c * (x1*x1*x1-x1*x1*x3+x2*x2*x3+2*x1*(x2*x2+x3*x3))
    y2 = (lambda-4)*x2 - 1.5*c * x2 * (2*x1*x1+x2*x2+2*x1*x3+2*x3*x3)
    y3 = (lambda-9)*x3 + 0.5*c * (x1*(x1*x1-3*x2*x2)-3*x3*(2*x1*x1+2*x2*x2+x3*x3))
    return [y1, y2, y3]
end
```

Notice that for our example we use the parameter value ``\lambda = 3\pi``.
In this particular case, one can show numerically that the system has seven
equilibrium solutions. These are approximately given as follows:

- Two equilibria ``\pm(1.45165, \; 0, \; 0.24396)`` of index 0.
- Two equilibria ``\pm(0, \; 1.09796, \; 0)`` of index 1.
- Two equilibria ``\pm(0, \; 0, \; 0.307238)`` of index 2.
- One equilibrium ``(0, \; 0, \; 0)`` of index 3.

In order to find the associated Morse decomposition, one can use the
commands

```julia
N = 25
bmax = [1.8, 1.5, 1.0]
lc, coordsI = create_cubical_box(N,N,N);
coordsN = convert_spatial_coordinates(coordsI, -bmax, bmax);
mvf = create_spatial_mvf(lc, coordsN, allencahn3d);
```

These commands create a cubical box of size ``25 \times 25 \times 25``
which covers the region ``[-1.8,1.8] \times [-1.5,1.5] \times [-1.0,1.0]``.
In addition, we construct a multivector field `mvf` which encapsulates
the possible dynamics of the system. After these preparations, the Morse
decomposition can be computed via

```julia
morsedecomp = morse_sets(lc, mvf);
morseinterval = morse_interval(lc, mvf, morsedecomp);
lci, mvfi = restrict_dynamics(lc, mvf, morseinterval);
cmi = connection_matrix(lci, mvfi);
```

While the first command finds the actual Morse decomposition, the second
one restricts the Lefschetz complex and the multivector field to the
smallest isolated invariant set which contains all Morse sets and 
connecting orbits between them. The last command finds the connection
matrix.

To see whether the above commands did indeed find the correct dynamical
behavior, we first inspect the computed Conley indices of the Morse
sets:

```julia
julia> cmi.conley
7-element Vector{Vector{Int64}}:
 [1, 0, 0, 0]
 [1, 0, 0, 0]
 [0, 1, 0, 0]
 [0, 1, 0, 0]
 [0, 0, 1, 0]
 [0, 0, 1, 0]
 [0, 0, 0, 1]
```

Clearly, these are the correct indices based on our numerical information 
concerning the stationary states of the system. The connection matrix 
is given by:

```julia
julia> full_from_sparse(cmi.matrix)
7×7 Matrix{Int64}:
 0  0  1  1  0  0  0
 0  0  1  1  0  0  0
 0  0  0  0  1  1  0
 0  0  0  0  1  1  0
 0  0  0  0  0  0  1
 0  0  0  0  0  0  1
 0  0  0  0  0  0  0
```

Thus, there are a total of ten connecting orbits that are induced
through algebraic topology. The index 3 equilibrium at the origin
has connections to each of the index 2 solutions, which lie above
and below the origin in the direction of the ``x_3``-axis. Each of
the latter two stationary states has connections to both index 1
equilibria. Finally, each of these is connected to both stable
states.

![The dynamics of an Allen-Cahn model](img/allencahn3d_3_25.png)

The location of the computed Morse sets is illustrated in the
accompanying figure, which uses ``x``, ``y``, and ``z`` instead
of the variable names ``x_1``, ``x_2``, and ``x_3``, respectively.
Notice that while the stationary states of index 0, 2, and 3 are
all well-localized, this cannot be said about the two equilibria
of index 1. The computed enclosures for the latter two are elongated
cubical sets which are shown along the upper left and lower right
of the figure. This overestimation is a result of the use of a strict
cubical grid, combined with the small discretization size `N = 25`.
Nevertheless, the above simple code does reproduce the overall
global dynamical behavior of the ordinary differential equation
correctly.

One can also compute over Morse intervals, rather than the complete
Morse decomposition. The final two images show two views of the 
Morse interval which corresponds to one of the index 1 equilibria,
and the two stable stationary states. These computations were 
performed with the finer resolution `N = 51`.
