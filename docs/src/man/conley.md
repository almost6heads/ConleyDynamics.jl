# Conley Theory

Here we need a more detailed description of Conley theory, and in particular
connection matrices.  In particular, this should discuss the various field types
that can be used, as well as all the entries in the [`ConleyMorseCM`](@ref) data
structure.

## Analyzing a Planar System using Cubical Complexes

Our next example illustrates how `ConleyDynamics.jl` can be used to analyze
the global dynamics of a planar ordinary differential equations. For this,
consider the planar system

```math
   \begin{array}{rcl}
     \dot{x}_1 & = &  x_2 - x_1 \left( x_1^2 + x_2^2 - 4 \right)
       \left( x_1^2 + x_2^2 - 1 \right) \\[1ex]
     \dot{x}_2 & = & -x_1 - x_2 \left( x_1^2 + x_2^2 - 4 \right)
       \left( x_1^2 + x_2^2 - 1 \right)
   \end{array}
```

This system has already been considered in [mrozek:etal:22a](@cite).
The right-hand side of this vector field can be implemented using
the Julia function

```@example Ccircle
using ..ConleyDynamics # hide
function circlevf(x::Vector{Float64})
    #
    # Sample vector field with nontrivial Morse decomposition
    #
    x1, x2 = x
    c0 = x1*x1 + x2*x2
    c1 = (c0 - 4.0) * (c0 - 1.0)
    y1 =  x2 - x1 * c1
    y2 = -x1 - x2 * c1
    return [y1, y2]
end
```

To analyze the global dynamics of this vector field, we first create
a cubical complex covering the square ``[-3, 3]^2`` using the commands

```@example Ccircle
n = 51
lc, coords = create_cubical_rectangle(n,n);
coordsN = convert_planar_coordinates(coords,[-3.0,-3.0],[3.0,3.0]);
lc.ncells
```

As the last result shows, this gives a Lefschetz complex with 10609
cells. The multivector field can be generated using

```@example Ccircle
mvf = create_planar_mvf(lc, coordsN, circlevf);
length(mvf)
```

This multivector field consists of 2437 multivectors. Finally, the 
connection matrix can be determined using the command

```@example Ccircle
cm = connection_matrix(lc, mvf, p=2);
cm.poincare
```

Therefore, the above planar system has three isolated invariant sets.
One has the Conley index of a stable equilibrium, while the other two
have that of a stable and an unstable periodic orbit. The columns of
the connection matrix correspond to these invariant sets as follows

```@example Ccircle
cm.poset
```

The connection matrix itself is given by

```@example Ccircle
full_from_sparse(cm.cm)
```

This implies that there are connecting orbits from the unstable 
periodic orbit to both the stable equilibrium, and the stable
periodic orbit. To visualize these Morse sets, we employ the 
commands

```julia
fname = "cubicalcircles.pdf"
plot_planar_cubical_morse(lc, fname, cm.morsesets, pv=true)
```

To constrast the above example with the use of a Delaunay triangulation,
we reanalyze the vector field in the following way:

```julia
lc2, coords2 = create_simplicial_delaunay(400, 400, 10, 30)
coords2N = convert_planar_coordinates(coords2,[-3.0,-3.0], [3.0,3.0])
mvf2 = create_planar_mvf(lc2, coords2N, circlevf)
cm2 = connection_matrix(lc2, mvf2, p=2)

fname2 = "cubicalcircles2.pdf"
plot_planar_simplicial_morse(lc2, coords2N, fname2, cm2.morsesets, pv=true)
```

In this case, the Morse sets can be visualized as in the figure.

Notice that we can also show the individual multivectors in more detail.
For the above example, we can plot all multivectors of the multivector
field `mvf2` which consist of at least 10 cells using the commands

```julia
mv_indices = findall(x -> (length(x)>9), mvf2)
large_mv = mvf2[mv_indices]

fname3 = "cubicalcircles3.pdf"
plot_planar_simplicial_morse(lc2, coords2N, fname3, large_mv, pv=true)
```

Note that in this example, there are only 20 large multivectors.
